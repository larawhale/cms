# Larawhale CMS - A Laravel CMS package

A Laravel package that provides the features of a content management system to any new or existing Laravel application.

This package uses a simple concept of two entities, entries and fields. Entries can be seen as models, where fields are the properties of these models.

The goal of this package is to take the implementation of managing content out of the hands of the developer while maintaining as much customizability as possible. It is important to keep the development process the same as how developers are used to while using the Laravel framework.

## Example

The following example displays how a confgured entry is displayed in the user interface.
